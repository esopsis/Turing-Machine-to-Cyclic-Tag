# Turing-Machine-to-Cyclic-Tag
Compiles a Turing machine to a Cyclic tag system.

This code is based off of an algorithm discribed here:

Cook, Matthew . "A Concrete View of Rule 110 Computation ." CSP (2008) . 

and Here: 

T . Neary, D . Woods, P-completeness of cellular automaton rule 110, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4051
	(2006) 132\[Dash]143.
  
and also based of some code from here:

S . Wolfram, A  New  Kind  of  Science, Champaign, IL: Wolfram Media, Inc ., 2002 pp . 1113.*)

It all runs in the Wolfram Language / Mathematica.

If you don't have a copy of Mathematica, you can run it here:
